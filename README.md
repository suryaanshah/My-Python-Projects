# Descriptions of Projects
Let's start to code in python!
Python is an object oriented language and is gaining popularity amongst young coders.
Python has various uses in data-science, web and game development, software development, and many more!
If you wish to learn python by looking at my GitHub repositories, then you are most welcome! Also, if you find any bug, have a new idea and want to share it with the community, then you can use either the [discussion](https://github.com/suryaanshchawla/My-Python-Projects/discussions) or file an [issue](https://github.com/suryaanshchawla/My-Python-Projects/issues).
The single most important rule of learning anything new is to get ready in getting your hands muddy.
Just looking at my code won't help much. You would have to experiment with my code or write a new program yourself from scratch! and discover new possibilities every now and then.

# Why these projects
I am a big follower of the feynman technique, in which when we are learning something new, we teach others about it. So this repo is one of those.

# Projects
This section will cover the description of the projects in this repository. Each heading will be linked to the wiki page of that project. The wiki will explain the following aspects of that project:
- [Idea](https://youtu.be/SObDW4fXRZQ)
- [Algorithmic Flowchart](https://youtu.be/HYAXws5_bLo)
- [Prerequisites](https://tinyurl.com/y3qpxb6t)
- Explaination of the Concepts Used
## [Is Mr. X alive?](https://github.com/suryaanshchawla/My-Python-Projects/wiki/_new?wiki%5Bname%5D=_Sidebar)
This is a simple game which takes input(Is Mr. X alive) from the user and then dispays the output(Yes-Stay safe from Covid-19; No-Om Shanti(A sanskrit proverb used to tell "hope there be peace"))
